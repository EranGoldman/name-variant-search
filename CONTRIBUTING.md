## Want to report an issue or request a feature?

This project consists of two separate codebases, one for the frontend search interface, and another for the generation of suggested name variants.

Is there a problem with the user interface, such as button not working or a visual bug,
please open an issue here:

https://github.com/bellingcat/name-variant-search/issues

Is there a name variant that you expect to see but is not included in the results?

### Tips for writing an effective issue:

 * Remember to search the list of open issues first, to avoid duplicates. If you see your issue has already been reported by someone else, feel free to add a comment or simply a "üëç" reaction to the bottom of their report.

 * Keep the title short but descriptive like an email subject line, such as "Ukranian spelling variations"

 * Write a detailed description, including specific examples and screenshots. You can also reference other related issues by number to link to them, e.g., [#3](https://github.com/bellingcat/name-variant-search/issues/8).

 * Be excellent to each other. Software issues can be frustrating. Remember to comment with kindness.
